	Artificial Intelligence (AI) still faces challenges in collaborating with humans as part of a multi-agent system. To develop AI that can seamlessly interact with humans, it is important to promote interdisciplinary collaboration between diverse communities, including multi-agent, game theory, human-AI interaction, and language. This workshop aims to provide a platform for such collaboration and develop human-centric AI.

<p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, with millions of people using them to help with tasks or decision-making. As these models become more proficient at handling tasks on peoples’ behalf, our society will transition from one centered around human interactions to one in which humans and foundation models interact in open ecosystems. This workshop aims to study these emerging trends and gain insights into a new ecosystem where both humans and foundation models coexist dynamically. However, such a multiagent system poses distinctive challenges due to the varying expertise, biases, and answers associated with each foundation model. Additional complexities include potential noncooperative interactions among entities, incomplete information about the task at hand, and the curse of dimensionality, all of which contribute to the difficulty of understanding possible behaviors of foundation model ecosystems.</p>

<p>To address these challenges and identify key properties of multiagent systems of interacting humans and foundation models, this workshop will provide a unifying platform for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers from various fields, including multiagent systems, game theory, human-AI interaction, and language. Specifically, contributions may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p><b>Human-AI interactions.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>What types of interactions are most helpful for training such systems of interacting foundation models?</li>
    <li>When interacting with humans, what mechanisms should teams of foundation models use to gauge when and who to ask for help?</li>
    <li>How can we structure interactions between humans and foundation models such that high-welfare outcomes emerge (and low-welfare outcomes do not)?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Multiagent learning & game theory.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Multiagent systems often have multiple equilibria: how can we solve the problem of equilibrium selection in the context of a foundation model ecosystem? In particular, which particular equilibria will emerge, and how can we control and align models accordingly?</li>
    <li>How can we address the “curse of multiagency” when potentially millions of foundation models interact to make decisions in online ecosystems?</li>
    <li>What are methods that can be used to model human behaviors and infer potentially hidden human intentions?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Language.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>What insights can we gain from multiagent methods for improving language models?</li>
    <li>How can we use large language models to reduce the sample complexity of multiagent learning?</li>
    <li>How can we expose key decisions made by our language models that are interpretable and correctable by external learning systems/regulators?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>General questions.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>What ethical, socioeconomic, and financial issues arise when faced with large-scale ecosystems of multiple interacting foundation models?</li>
    <li>What benchmarks, datasets, and tools should be used to evaluate such a foundation model ecosystem?</li>
    <li>How can we best simulate expensive multiagent interactions in an offline manner by leveraging large datasets?</li>
</ul>

<p>Our program offers a unique interactive platform through invited talks, poster sessions, panel discussions, a networking event, and a demo track, where participants actively interact with each other using foundation models (please refer to the “Community Building and Discussion Opportunities” section below for details). This workshop will provide a great opportunity to discuss challenging problems, brainstorm solutions, and foster future collaborations about interactive systems involving multiple foundation models.</p>
